# Freight Insights — Real-time Booking Insights Engine

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time insights engine for freight booking. When a user enters Agent / Origin / Destination / Product during booking, the system returns:
- Historical shipment patterns
- Price intelligence (internal + external)
- Capacity trends
- Risk/exception indicators
- Predictive signals (ETA delays, rate changes)
- Recommended actions

This is a starter scaffold. Replace mocked/exemplar areas with vendor connectors and production models.
